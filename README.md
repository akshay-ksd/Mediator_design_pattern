🚀 Improve State Management in React With the Mediator Design Pattern 🚀

Are you tired of dealing with complex state management in your React applications? 🤯 The Mediator design pattern can come to the rescue! 🦸‍♂️

🔍 Identify Shared State: Analyze your app and identify the shared state that multiple components need to access or modify.

💡 Create a Mediator: Implement a Mediator component as the central hub for state management. It will store and manage the shared state, providing methods for components to interact with it.

📜 Register Components: Allow components that need access to the shared state to register themselves with the Mediator during the lifecycle.

📲 Expose Methods for Communication: Instead of components directly interacting with each other's state, they should use the Mediator's methods to communicate and modify the shared state.

🔄 Update Components On State Changes: The Mediator will notify the relevant components about changes, enabling them to update their views accordingly.

🔒 Unregister Components: Components should unregister themselves from the Mediator when they are unmounted to avoid memory leaks.

🚀 Level up your React state management with the Mediator pattern today! 🚀
